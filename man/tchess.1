GAME

GET STARTED

Tchess can save your game in a file, then you can continue that game later. If you run the above command, game will be saved in game.tchess file in current working directory.
Also Tchess can handle online multiplayer game on local network (P2P).

But you can customize the file:

\f(CW$ tchess my-game.bin\fR

Also if you played a game and closed that and now you want to continue that game, only give file name as argument:

\f(CW$ tchess my-old-game.bin\fR

(The .bin extension is a example, you can name it whatever you want).

white Turn >>>

The above content will be showed in the terminal. and there is a command input in the bottom. You should pass commands to that for running the game.

Also there is white Turn. this means its turn of white team. if you do something, this will be changed to black Turn.

Also name of Pieces is <team>\-<type>. for example b\-queen (black queen) and w\-king (white king).

The location of cells is accessible with this pattern: <row>\-<column> or <row>.<column>. For example 1\-1 or 6.4.
exit

command exit, exits the program:

>>> exit

Moving the pieces

For moving pieces, you should enter this command:

>>> move <src> to <dst>

for example:

>>> move 2.1 to 4.1

Also you can use mv keyword instead of move:

>>> mv a to b

Also you can don't use to keyword. for example:

>>> mv 2.1 3.1

Also you can see which pieces in the board are allowed to go to the which cells:

>>> s 2.2

The above command s <cell\-address>, will show you the piece in the entered address can go to which cells (The allowed cells will be highlighted with *).
Back

You can revert your moves and back to the previous status.

>>> back

This is useful if you insert a wrong command or move wrong.
(This command will be disabled for guest in online mode)

Replaying a saved game

If you played a game and it is saved, you can play that!

You should use option \fB\-\-replay\fR:

\f(CW$ tchess --replay my-saved-game.file\fR

Then you can see your game is Replaying!

Also you can set frame speed of Replaying using \fB\-\-replay\-speed\fR option:

\f(CW$ tchess --replay my-saved-game.file --replay-speed=3 # means 3 seound\fR
.br
\f(CW$ tchess --replay my-saved-game.file --replay-speed=0.5\fR

(sort of options is not important).

Online multiplayer

By default, Tchess runs a offline game for you that you should play on one terminal. Means both of players should use one computer alongside together.

But you can play with your friend with two computers (on local network).

Means one player will be Server and othe player will be guest.

Game will be handled by Server computer. and guest will be connected to server and play.

To serve a game, run this command:

\f(CW$ tchess --online\fR

# OR
$ tchess \fB\-\-online\fR \fB\-\-port=\fR<port> \fB\-\-host=\fR<host>
# Example
$ tchess \fB\-\-online\fR \fB\-\-port\fR=\fI\,5000\/\fR \fB\-\-host\fR=\fI\,0\/\fR.0.0.0

then, the guest player can join the game by running this command:

\f(CW$ tchess --connect <host>:<port>\fR

# Example
$ tchess \fB\-\-connect\fR 192.168.1.2:5000

Also guest can determine the name:

\f(CW$ tchess --connect 192.168.1.2:5000 --name="guest name"\fR

Also server player can use more options:

# set color of guest player (default is black)
$ tchess \fB\-\-online\fR \fB\-\-guest\-color\fR=\fI\,white\/\fR
